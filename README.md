# eight-dollars-for-firefox

eight-dollars-for-firefox does one simple thing: it changes the checkmarks of twitter accounts to dollars, to help maintain sanity against the non-sense of calling paid accounts "verified".

The original extension was meant to help tell the difference between actual verified accounts and twitter blue users. But now this does not make much sense anymore, as the legacy accounts do not exist (twitter/x removed their checkmarks unless they paid). So everybody who pays should get a dollar in place of a mark now.

Accounts with blue checkmark get a blue dollar instead. Organisations/companies which pay even more for gold checkmarks receive gold dollars. Official Government or International Organisations with gray checkmarks, retain the gray checkmarks.

This is a fork of the [original extension](https://github.com/wseagar/eight-dollars) which is maintained by [Will Seagar](https://twitter.com/willseagar), [Walter Lim](https://twitter.com/iWaltzAround), and [Ilia Sidorenko](https://twitter.com/noway421). I forked it and maintain it because they stopped maintaining the firefox version, which is stuck in version 1.6 as of August 2024, and does not work after twitter.com redirects to x.com. As the maintainers did not answer my inquiry whether they intend to update the firefox version, I just forked it and publish it as a firefox add-on. Plus, I made a few feature additions (gold accounts, gray checkmarks, legacy use setting).
